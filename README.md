# Data Pagination & Filtering

[View demo](https://alexhippo.github.io/data-pagination-and-filtering/)

This app demonstrates data pagination, filtering and DOM Manipulation techniques using a list of example student records. My project code was written in vanilla JS and not dependent on third party or external libraries. This project was created as part of the [Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree course](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/full-stack-javascript).
